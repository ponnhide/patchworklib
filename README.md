# patchworklib
[Patchworklib](https://github.com/ponnhide/patchworklib) is a universal composer of matplotlib-related plots (simple matplotlib plots, Seaborn plots (both axis-level and figure-level), and plotnine plots). This library is inspired by [patchwork](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) for ggplot2. Accordingly, as original patchwork, users can easily align matplotlib plots with only "/" and "|" operators. Although a good subplot composer, "subplot_mosaic" is provided from matplotlib formally, I believe the way of patchworklib is more straightforward and more flexible.

Additionally, several third-party libraries based on matplotlib, such as plotnine and seaborn, provide functions to generate beautiful plots with simple python codes, but many of those plots cannot be handled as matplotlib subplots. Therefore, their placement must be adjusted manually. Now, scientists spend their valuable time arranging figures.

Patchworklib provides a solution for the problem. By using patchworklib, any kind of seaborn and plotnine plots can be handled as matplotlib subplots.

## Installation
For normal users, we recommended you to install the official release as follows.  
`pip install patchworklib`

If you want to use developmental version, it can be installed using the following single command:  
`pip install git+https://github.com/ponnhide/patchworklib.git`

## News
- Developmental verion on GitHub practically supports plotnine version 0.12.1. 
- Modified `align_xlabels` and `align_ylabels` functions so that they support to align labels on subplots.

#### 05162023: version 0.6.1 is released.
- I could not fully support plotnine version 0.12.1 (It works, but patchworklib arrangement results are not as expected). I will do not support plotnine in the future. 
- Bricks object gained the new methods `align_xlabels` and  `align_ylabels`, which help users align x/y labels of the given Brick object.
- The new argument `equal_spacing` was added to the stack function. If this value is `True`, axes bounding-boxes should be placed with equal spacing between them. Otherwise, depending on the text values of x/y tick labels and x/y labels, they may not always be equally spaced.
- Closed and maybe solved the issue ["Align labels of Bricks when subplot axes are aligned. #40"](https://github.com/ponnhide/patchworklib/issues/40) 
- Closed and maybe solved the issue ["Doesn't work with Plotnine Seaborn Theme. #37"](https://github.com/ponnhide/patchworklib/issues/37)
- Closed and maybe solved the issue ["The position of the title cannot be set in plotnine. #36"](https://github.com/ponnhide/patchworklib/issues/36)

#### Arranging seaborn gridded plots 
Patchworklib supported the function to arange multiple seborn plots generated based on axisgrid (FacetGrid, PairGrid, and JointGrid).
Let's see the follwoing example.

```python
import os
import seaborn as sns
import patchworklib as pw
from functools import reduce
pw.overwrite_axisgrid() #When you use pw.load_seagorngrid, 'overwrite_axisgrid' should be executed.

df = sns.load_dataset("penguins")
g1  = sns.pairplot(df, hue="species")
g1  = pw.load_seaborngrid(g1)
g1.move_legend("upper left", bbox_to_anchor=(0.08,1.01))

planets = sns.load_dataset("planets")
cmap = sns.cubehelix_palette(rot=-.2, as_cmap=True)
g2 = sns.relplot(
    data=planets,
    x="distance", y="orbital_period",
    hue="year", size="mass",
    palette=cmap, sizes=(10, 200),
)
g2.set(xscale="log", yscale="log")
g2.ax.xaxis.grid(True, "minor", linewidth=.25)
g2.ax.yaxis.grid(True, "minor", linewidth=.25)
g2.despine(left=True, bottom=True)
g2 = pw.load_seaborngrid(g2)

penguins = sns.load_dataset("penguins")
g3 = sns.jointplot(
    data=penguins,
    x="bill_length_mm", y="bill_depth_mm", hue="species",
    kind="kde",
)
g3 = pw.load_seaborngrid(g3, labels=["joint","marg_x","marg_y"])
((g2/g3["marg_x"])|g1).savefig()
```

#### "stack" fucntion
I implemented the `stack` function. This function allows users to arrange multiple (more than two) Brick or Bricks objects along the specified direction as follows.

```python
import patchworklib as pw
ax_list = []
for i in range(10):
    ax_list.append(pw.Brick(figsize=(2,2), label="ax{}".format(i)))
stacked_axes = pw.stack(ax_list, operator="|", margin=0.2)
stacked_axes.savefig()
```

#### 01142022: Version 0.1.0 was released.  
- Patchworklib was now avialable through pip.

<details>
<summary> <b>01132022: "spacer" class was implemented and "case" parameter was added to Bricks class.</b> </summary>

**Add empty spaces around a plot** 
```python
#preparation of plot data
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib as mpl
import patchworklib as pw

data1 = 20 * np.random.rand(100,100) - 10
data2 = 20 * np.random.rand(100,100) - 10
cmap = mpl.cm.Reds
norm = mpl.colors.Normalize(vmin=-10, vmax=10)
ax1 = pw.Brick("axx", figsize=(3,3))
ax2 = pw.Brick("axy", figsize=(3,3))
ax1.imshow(data1, interpolation='nearest', cmap=cmap, aspect="auto")
ax2.imshow(data2, interpolation='nearest', cmap=cmap, aspect="auto")
```

w/o spacer
```python
ax_cb    = pw.Brick("ax_cb", figsize=(0.1,3))
cb       = mpl.colorbar.ColorbarBase(ax_cb, cmap=cmap, norm=norm)
ax12     = ax1|ax2
heatmap2 = ax12 | ax_cb
heatmap2.savefig()
```

w/ spacer
```python

heatmap2 = ax12 | (pw.spacer(ax_cb2,0.5)/ax_cb2/pw.spacer(ax_cb2,0.5))
heatmap2.savefig()
```
<img src="img/heatmap-2.png" width="400x400">

**Super titile for multiple plots**  
Sometimes, all that is needed to have common labels and title for multiple plots.   
By specifying `case` parameter of a Bricks class object, common matplotlib artist ojbects for multiple plots can be handled.
```python
ax12.case.set_title("A global title for multiple plots", pad=10)
heatmap2 = ax12|(pw.spacer(ax_cb,0.5)/ax_cb/pw.spacer(ax_cb,0.5))
heatmap2.savefig("")

fmri = sns.load_dataset("fmri")
ax1 = pw.Brick(figsize=(3,2))
sns.lineplot(x="timepoint", y="signal", hue="region", style="event", data=fmri, ax=ax1)
ax1.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1.0), loc='upper left')
ax1.set_title("ax1")
 
titanic = sns.load_dataset("titanic")
ax2 = pw.Brick(figsize=(1,2))
sns.barplot(x="sex", y="survived", hue="class", data=titanic, ax=ax2)

The follwoing tutorial codes can be executable in [tutorial1](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TVcH3IJy6geDXVJDfOKCPFPsP2GzjxHu?usp=sharing)

#### 1. Importing patchworklib library

```python
import patchworklib as pw 
fmri = sns.load_dataset("fmri")
ax1 = pw.Brick("ax1", figsize=(4,2))
sns.lineplot(x="timepoint", y="signal", hue="region", style="event", data=fmri, ax=ax1)
ax1.move_legend(new_loc='upper right')
ax1.set_title("ax1")
```

#### 2. Creating example plots
 
Creating some example plots using the searborn module. Brick class provided by the patchworklib module is implemented as subclass of `matplotlib.axes.Axes`.  Therefore, Brick class object can be given to the seaborn plot functions that have the `ax` parameters.  

When creating a Brick class object, the `label` value should be specified, and it should be unique among the Brick class objects generated in the python script (If the label value is not specified, the unique label name is automatically given. By using `get_label()` method, the value can be confirmed). The `figisize` parameter can also be specified. However, the value is not very important because the figure size of Brick class objects can be automatically adjusted in arranging the plots. The `savefig(`*`filename=str`*`)` method returns `matplotlib.figure.Figure` class object. If `filename` is given, the figure object can be output to the file.

```python
import seaborn as sns
#Example plot 1 (ref: https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/errorband_lineplots.html)
fmri = sns.load_dataset("fmri")
ax1 = pw.Brick("ax1", figsize=(4,2))
sns.lineplot(x="timepoint", y="signal", hue="region", style="event", data=fmri, ax=ax1)
ax1.move_legend(new_loc='upper right')
ax1.set_title("ax1")
ax1.savefig()
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponnhide/patchworklib/main/img/ax1.png" width="350x350">

Brick class provides the `movelegend(`*`loc=str, bbox_to_anchor=(float,float)`*`)` method. By using this method, legend location can be quickly modified.

```python
#Example plot 2 (ref: https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/categorical.html)
titanic = sns.load_dataset("titanic")
ax2 = pw.Brick("ax2", figsize=(1,2))
sns.barplot(x="sex", y="survived", hue="class", data=titanic, ax=ax2)
ax2.move_legend(new_loc='upper left', bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1.0)) #Original method of Blick class
ax2.set_title("ax2")
ax2.savefig()
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponnhide/patchworklib/main/img/ax2.png" width="250x250">

```python
#Example plot 3 (ref: https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/histogram_stacked.html)
diamonds = sns.load_dataset("diamonds")
ax3 = pw.Brick("ax3", (5,2))
sns.histplot(diamonds, x="price", hue="cut", multiple="stack",
    palette="light:m_r", edgecolor=".3", linewidth=.5, log_scale=True,
    ax = ax3)
ax3.set_title("ax3")
ax3.savefig()
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponnhide/patchworklib/main/img/ax3.png" width="400x400">

```python
#Example plot 4 (ref:https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/grouped_violinplots.html)
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
ax4 = pw.Brick("ax4", (6,2))
sns.violinplot(data=tips, x="day", y="total_bill", hue="smoker",
    split=True, inner="quart", linewidth=1,
    palette={"Yes": "b", "No": ".85"},
    ax=ax4)
ax4.set_title("ax4")
ax4.savefig("../img/ax4.png")
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponnhide/patchworklib/main/img/ax4.png" width="400x400">

```python
#Example plot 5 (ref:https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/wide_data_lineplot.html)
rs = np.random.RandomState(365)
values = rs.randn(365, 4).cumsum(axis=0)
dates = pd.date_range("1 1 2016", periods=365, freq="D")
data = pd.DataFrame(values, dates, columns=["A", "B", "C", "D"])
data = data.rolling(7).mean()
ax5 = pw.Brick("ax5", (5,2))
sns.lineplot(data=data, palette="tab10", linewidth=2.5, ax=ax5)
ax5.set_xlabel("date")
ax5.set_ylabel("value")
ax5.set_title("ax5")
ax5.savefig()
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponnhide/patchworklib/main/img/ax5.png" width="400x400">

#### 3. Arranging and stacking plots

The patchworklib module provides two operators " `|`", "`/`" that enable designing tidy layout for multiple plots with simple operations. The "`|`" operator will place the plots beside each other, while the "`/`" operator will stack them.

```python
#Arrange "ax1," "ax2," and "ax4" horizontally.
ax124 = ax1|ax2|ax4
ax124.savefig("../img/ax124.png")
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponnhide/patchworklib/main/img/ax124.png" width="1000x1000">

The object generated by arranging multiple Brick object (Bricks class object) can also be arranged and stacked with other Brick objects.  Additionally, It is  possible to create more complex layouts by nesting the operations.

```python
ax12435 = ax124/(ax3|ax5)
ax12435.savefig("../img/ax12435.png")
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponnhide/patchworklib/main/img/ax12435.png" width="1000x1000">

You can quickly test another layout by rearranging them.

```python
ax35214 = (ax3/(ax2|ax1))|(ax5/ax4)
ax35214.savefig()
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponnhide/patchworklib/main/img/ax35214.png" width="1000x1000">

If you want to adjust the margins between objects, please change the value of `.param["margin"]`.

```python
pw.param["margin"]=0.2 #Default value is 0.5.
ax35214 = (ax3/(ax2|ax1))|(ax5/ax4)

Also, the aspect ratios of each plot can be freely modifiable.

```python
pw.param["margin"]=0.5
ax1.change_aspectratio((4,2))
ax3.change_aspectratio((4,1))
ax4.change_aspectratio((5,2))
ax35214_v2 = (ax3/(ax2|ax1))|(ax5/ax4)
ax35214_v2.savefig()
```

#### 4. Packing plots with label indexing (Advanced method)

By specifying the Brick objects in a Bricks object with their label name, you can adjust the position of another Brick object to be packed. 

```python
ax321 = ax3/(ax2|ax1)
ax321.savefig("../img/ax321.png")
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponnhide/patchworklib/main/img/ax321.png" width="600x600">

```python
ax3214 = ax321["ax1"]|ax4
ax3214.savefig("../img/ax3214.png")
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponnhide/patchworklib/main/img/ax3214.png" width="1000x1000">

```python
ax35214_v3 = ax3214["ax3"]|ax5
ax35214_v3.savefig("../img/ax35214_v3.png")
```

The above packing process allows the axes of the objects to be accurately aligned with each other. Actually, in "ax35214" and "ax35214_v2", the bottom axis lines of ax3 and ax5 are not precisely aligned, while in "ax35214_v3", their bottom axis lines are exactly aligned. However, please note that this packing method using label indexing changes aspect ratios of the Brick objects to be packed from the original one to align their axis lines with others.
