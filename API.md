## Basic functions

- ### **`load_ggplot(ggplot=None, figsize=None)`**

  Convert a plotnine plot object to a `patchworklib.Bricks` object.

  #### Parameters

  - `ggplot`: plotnine.ggplot.ggplot
  - `figsize`: tuple (float, float), 
      Figure size. If it is not specified, the generated Bricks object would keep the 
      original figure size of the given ggplot objecrt.

  #### Returns

  `patchworklib.Bricks` object
  

- ### **`overwrite_axisgrid()`**

  Overwrite the `__init__` methods in `seaborn.axisgrid.xxGrid` classes.
  The function changes the figure object given in the `__init__` functions of the 
  axisgrid class objects, which is used for drawing plots, to `_basefigure` 
  in the patchworklib. If you want to load the plots generated based on 
  `seabron.axisgrid.xxGrid` objects as `patchworklib.Brick(s)` object using 
  `load_seaborngrid` function, you should execute this function in advance.

  #### Returns

  `None`

- ### **`load_seabornobj(g, label=None, labels=None, figsize=(3, 3))`**

  Load a seaborn plot generated based on `seaborn._core.plot.Plotter` class. 
  Using this function, plots generated by [object-oriented seaborn interface](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/objects_interface.html) can be handled as a `patchworklib.Brick(s)` class object.

  #### Parameters

  - **`g`**: `seaborn._core.plot.Plot object` object
      A return value of a seaborn plot generated by [object-oriented seaborn interface](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/objects_interface.html).
  - **`label`**: str 
      Unique identifier for the `patchworklib.Brick(s)` class object to be returned. 
      If you want to adjust a layout composed of multiple bricks object using the label 
      indexing method, providing the unique label name for returned object should be 
      encouraged.
  - **`figsize`**: tuple (float, float) 
      Figure size. If it is not specified, convert Bricks object would keep the original 
      figure size of the given seaborn plot. 

  #### Returns

  `patchworklib.Bricks` object

- ### **`load_seaborngrid(g, label=None, labels=None, figsize=None)`**

  Load seaborn plot generated based on seaborn.axisgrid.xxGrid class.   
  In generally, seaborn plots generated by figure-level fucntion cannot be 
  handles as subplot(s) with other matplotlib plots, However, by processing 
  these seaborn plots via the function, you can handle them as 
  `patchworklib.Brick(s)` class objects. 

  #### Notes

  You should execute `overwrite_axisgrid` function before using this function.

  #### Parameters

      distplot, catplot, jointplot and pairplot.
  - **`label`**: str 
      Unique identifier for the `patchworklib.Brick(s)` class object to be returned. 
      If you want to adjust a layout composed of multiple bricks object using the label 
      indexing method, providing the unique label name for returned object should be 
      encouraged.
  - **`figsize`**: tuple (float, float) 
      Figure size. If it is not specified, convert Bricks object would keep the original 
      figure size of the given seaborn plot.
